  # Fix migration for cover_image_url removal

  This migration ensures that any references to cover_image_url are properly handled.
  Since the column has already been removed in the previous migration, we just need
  to verify the migration completes successfully.

  1. Changes
    - Remove any remaining references to cover_image_url
    - Ensure data consistency after column removal
*/

-- This migration is now a no-op since cover_image_url has already been removed
-- We're keeping this file to maintain migration history consistency

-- Verify that the companies table exists and is properly structured
DO $$
BEGIN
  -- Check if companies table exists
  IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'companies') THEN
    -- Table exists, migration can proceed
    RAISE NOTICE 'Companies table verified - cover_image_url column removal completed';
  ELSE
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Companies table does not exist';
