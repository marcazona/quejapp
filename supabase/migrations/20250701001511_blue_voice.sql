  # Fix Companies RLS for Admin Access

  1. Security Changes
    - Temporarily disable RLS on companies table to allow admin operations
    - Create service role policies for admin operations
    - Maintain public read access for the main app

  2. Admin Access
    - Allow unrestricted access for service role (admin operations)
    - Keep public read access for regular users
    - Prepare for future admin-specific authentication integration
