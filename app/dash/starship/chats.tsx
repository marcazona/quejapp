Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brackets. I've added the missing closing bracket for the `messageTimestamp` style and fixed the indentation:

```typescript
messageTimestamp: {
  fontSize: 12,
  color: '#CCCCCC',
  marginTop: 6,
  opacity: 0.7,
},
```

The issue was in the styles object where the `messageTimestamp` style was not properly closed. The rest of the file appears to be structurally sound with all other brackets properly matched.
