Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At line 1889, add missing closing bracket for productsContainer View
      </View>

// At line 2784, add missing closing bracket for styles object
});
```

The file was missing two closing brackets:

1. A closing bracket for the View component containing the products list
2. The final closing bracket for the StyleSheet.create styles object

The fixed version should now be properly balanced with all opening and closing brackets matched.
