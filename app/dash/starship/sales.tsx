Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At line 1889, add missing closing bracket for productsContainer View
      </View>

// At line 2784, add missing closing brace for styles StyleSheet
});
```

The file was missing two closing brackets:

1. A closing bracket `</View>` for the products container section
2. A closing brace `}` for the styles StyleSheet definition

The fixed version should now be properly closed and syntactically valid.
